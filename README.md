# MarkDown File Generator

Application that allows the user to create a high quality README.md that includes a title, description, table of contents, installation, how to use, license, contributing, testing, and a question section. It's optional to the user if they prefer a Table of Contents, and based on their choice we'll update. User can click the links in the Table of Contents to take the user to that section, and each section is formatted correctly. This README was also created from this application! :)
